AI-Powered Educational Platform (Next.js Upgrade)

Overview

This project is an AI-powered educational platform that was originally built with React.js and has been migrated to Next.js for improved performance, security, and scalability. The migration was done without starting a new project, ensuring a seamless transition.

Key Features & Improvements

ðŸš€ Migrated from React.js to Next.js

Refactored the project to use Next.jsâ€™s routing, SSR, and API routes.

Improved performance, SEO, and scalability.

No need for React Routerâ€”Next.jsâ€™s file-based routing simplifies navigation.

ðŸ”’ Secure API Calls (Moved to Backend)

Previously, API calls were made from the frontend, exposing the API key.

Now, all API requests are handled on the backend using Vercel serverless functions.

Ensured streaming responses still work for real-time interactions.

ðŸ›¡ Implemented Rate Limiting

Added rate limits to prevent API abuse.

Limits per minute, hour, and day to maintain API stability.

Users receive proper retry-after messages when limits are exceeded.

ðŸ’¬ Chat History (Explore Mode)

Implemented scrollable chat history (similar to Perplexity.ai).

Ensured smooth auto-scrolling and message retention.

ðŸŽµ Fixed Play/Pause Button (Playground Mode)

Previously, the button paused but didnâ€™t resume properly.

Now, seamless pausing and resuming with correct state handling.
